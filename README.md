# C Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my **C Programming Portfolio**!  
This repository is a collection of projects I have developed to practice, refine, and demonstrate my skills in the C programming language. Each project highlights different aspects of C programming, from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to serve as a portfolio of my work, showcasing:
- Proficiency in the C language
- Problem-solving abilities
- Experience with algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming
- Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

## Structure
The repository is organized into individual project folders. Each folder contains:
- Source code (`.c` files)
- Header files (`.h` files) where applicable
- A `README.md` or notes file with explanations of the project, features, and how to compile/run it

## Topics Covered
Some of the areas explored in these projects include:
- Basic syntax and control flow
- Functions and modular programming
- Pointers and memory management
- Arrays, strings, and file I/O
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)
- System-level and low-level programming concepts

## How to Use
To run a project:
1. Navigate into the project folder.
2. Compile the source code with a C compiler such as `gcc`.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o program
   ./program
